Epic As per the mahAbharata, the great war on the kuru field came to a conclusion with the smashing of duryodhana’s thighs by bhIma. While balarAma wanted to kill bhIma for unfairly defeating the kuru prince in the gadAyuddha, kR^iShNa convinced him to refrain from doing so. Thereafter, he led the surviving pANDu-s and his relative sAtyaki to rest in the enemy camp. But the remaining survivors on the pANDu side slept in their own camp.</description>

We earlier described the major problem termed the bhArata conundrum, where we notice a silence regarding the pANDavas alone in the vedic textual layers, but they are prominently mentioned in all the later texts of Sanskrit and prakrit literature. The following plausible theories may be cited in this regard:
The vedic authors were of the kaurava party and hence purposely omitted references to the pANDus. The main problem with this theory is why do they mention the descendents of the pANDava-s as per the great epic in very positive light.</description>

While the bhArata epic is a central to understanding the rise of the Indian state and the very culture of the Indian people, there are some mysterious issues associated with it which still leave a major gap in understanding this historical period. At its heart the epic represents the expansion of the kuru-pA~nchAla realm over the whole of Northern India, establish a unified administrative and cultural zone. The sequence of events leading to this as painted in the mbh are thus: 1) We have the rise of the bhAratas under their eponymous founder the great conqueror bharata daushyanti who raises this line of the pUru kShatriya clan to prominence and pre-eminent rulers amongst the Indo-Aryans.</description>

prahlAda, the demoniac son of hiraNyakashipu, ascended the throne of the asuras after his father had been slain by nR^isimha. Spreading fear and havoc in the in the worlds due to his pride and immense strength he caused much anxiety to the gods. It was then that the young kumAra, the commander of the deva army, filled with youthful pride decided to display his sports. He threw his shakti and pierced the earth with it.</description>

Reg. long thread pertaining to Alonso&amp;rsquo;s work. I sort of feel induced to comment.
I think what Alonso has noticed are mostly not specific similarities between the Mbh &amp;amp; Greek epic &amp;ndash; what in biology we would call synapomorphies. Rather they are motifs from the ancient IE past that are widely spread across the IE mythosphere. What they illustrate is that certain motifs were common to ancestral IE epic traditions &amp;amp; new historical events were fitted into these old thematic &amp;ldquo;wave-guides.</description>

      <description>map
Southern recensions mention groups like kerala/cherapada, choLa &amp;amp; pANDya. However, northern ones do not. andhra seems more universal &amp;ndash; the fighter chANUra or his aid killed by devakIputra was an andhra. Location of andhra was probably south of kali~Nga but a bit unclear to me.
Not central to the map but more related to below discussion. If we for a moment just include everything, i.e., don&amp;rsquo;t make an attempt a priori to distinguish interpolations from the core Mbh (leave aside the &amp;ldquo;critical&amp;rdquo;= Pune edition) we have following counts for &amp;ldquo;distant&amp;rdquo; peoples</description>
