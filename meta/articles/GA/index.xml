Bhīṣma was literally protected by 8 divine Brāhmaṇas during the battle &amp;amp; they tell him in a dream that night that he is like their own body &amp;amp; they will protect him from Paraśurāma &amp;amp; give him the Prasvapna mantra (which makes the victim sleep).
During the battle next day, Bhīṣma is unable to secure any advantage over Paraśurāma (&amp;amp; vice-versa) &amp;amp; decides to end the stalemate by invoking the Prasvapna mantra.</description>

In this sacred time of the year, we dedicate to शिव this thread about the role in the महाभारत of his particular form as श्रीकण्ठ-रुद्र.
व्यासः To add another point, after शिवसहस्रनाम was revealed by कृष्ण to युधिष्ठिर, different sages come to speak of the glory of worshipping शिव &amp;amp; among them, पराशर-ऋषि stated that he worshipped महादेव for a son who will be a वेदव्यास &amp;amp; शिव blesses him with more than what he asked.</description>
